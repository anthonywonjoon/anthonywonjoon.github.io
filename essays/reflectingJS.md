*JavaScript is celebrating its 28th birthday this year*

Learning to program, develop applications, to code, to become a computer scientist, is such a daughnting task at first. It definitely was for me when I started. Javascript seems to be an amazing step into this world with its non-complex syntax, minimal boilerplate code, and accessibility to resources. 

## My Experiences with JS

I learned Javascript around a year or two ago, the summer before taking a class called "Programming Application Systems", a required class for my Management Information Systems degree. At first, it seemed like I was reading a foreign language, despite it being in English. As I became more and more comfortable and familiar with it though, it became apparent to me how versatile and flexible Javascript was as a language. From the easy syntax, to the wide range of commonly used frameworks, to the infinite amount of free resources online, it was probably one of the most begineer friendly languages, while not being limited to this. Compared to other languages I know, such as Java, C#, and C, there is vastly less overhead that you need to get started, but there is no end to what you can do.<break>

I have recently started exploring frameworks such as React and Vue that are written in Javascript. They seem to be industry-standard frameworks used by many large companies. It has made creating web applications so easy and efficient. These frameworks are also very supported by their communities, resulting in massive libraries with functions for anything your heart desired. This coupled with also learning Typescript has been great in terms of development quality of life and education.

## Working Out Programming Muscles

The WOD system is something that I am familiar from a previous class. At first, I was not a fan. You definitely feel the pressure as you see the timer ticking up and up, almost getting to the next grade. It wasn't something that I was used to - writing code to solve a problem, and explaining what I am doing at the same time, all while under a time limit. However, throughout the course of that semester, I got better and better at it, and it really was benefitial looking back. I am excited for this semester's WODs as they are a great way of reinforcing what you know, while also being able to translate that to understandable statements. It was also great preparation for technical interviews, as they are basically WODs. 

Overall, I am looking forward to sharpenning my Javascript skills throughout this semester using activities such as the essays and WODs.

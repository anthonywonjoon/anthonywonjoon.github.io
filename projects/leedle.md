## UPDATE (14 Sept 2023)
I have begun the complete rework of Leedle. Here are some features that are soon to come:
- [ ] Visual Rework
- [ ] Rewriting of game logic for optimization
- [ ] Global Leaderboard
- [ ] Dark mode & Light mode

## NOTE
 This was my first attempt at a project when I first learned to code. At the moment, it is going through a complete rework from scratch, but until then, please enjoy the very first version

## About The Project

Leedle is a practice project of mine that I made after the surge in popularity around the web-game, Wordle.

## Features

### Gameplay

The Gameplay area is a five by 5x6 box. This means you have six guesses to find the correct 5 letter word.

The box will color itself after each guess according to the following color scheme: 

* Background Blue: Not guessed yet
* Dim Blue: Not present in word
* Yellow: Correct letter, but wrong space
* Green: Correct letter, correct space

Leedle has an on-screen keyboard that is not only clickable, but also highlights in four different colors
